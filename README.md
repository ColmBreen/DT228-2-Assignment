My assignment uses a dataset showing the total number of archaeological 
excavations which took place in each county of Ireland between the years of 1990 - 2014.
This dataset shows the impact which the recession had on archaeology in Ireland.

(First Deliverable 9th November)
I will represent this data through 2D bar charts, 3D bar charts and a wordle.
When the program is first run a bar chart, which can be switched between 2D and 3D,
will be shown with each bar representing the total excavations within a 5 year period.
Eg. (1990 - 1994), (1995 - 1999), etc. Each bar can be clicked on which will bring up
another similar bar chart representing each of the 5 years. These bars can also be clicked
on to show a wordle representing the number of ecavations to take place in each county that year.  

(Second Deliverable 7th December)
My program displays a start menu when run. When the mouse is clicked the start menu disappears and 
a bar chart is shown. Each bar of this bar chart represents a five year period. Each of these bars can
be clicked on to show a bar chart where each bar represents the individual years that the original graph
represented. I did not manage to create a 3-D version of these graphs as I had previously planned to.
When any of the bars representing single years is clicked a wordle is displayed. This contains the names of
all of the counties with the size of the text for each county set in relation to the number of excavations that
took place there that year. I was unfortunately unable to have this so that the words would not overlap.
