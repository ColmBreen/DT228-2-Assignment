My assignment uses a dataset showing the total number of archaeological 
excavations which took place in each county of Ireland between the years of 1990 - 2014.
This dataset shows the impact which the recession had on archaeology in Ireland.

I will represent this data through 2D bar charts, 3D bar charts and a wordle.
When the program is first run a bar chart, which can be switched between 2D and 3D,
will be shown with each bar representing the total excavations within a 5 year period.
Eg. (1990 - 1994), (1995 - 1999), etc. Each bar can be clicked on which will bring up
another similar bar chart representing each of the 5 years. These bars can also be clicked
on to show a wordle representing the number of ecavations to take place in each county that year.
